| **1. Key Value Store** | Distributed, durable, in-memory key-value database with replication, leader election, and snapshotting. Includes: metadata server (RAFT), storage server, dashboard, and client library. |
| **2. Online Store**                | A mock e-commerce system built for testing, with its modules (product service, order service, ordering UI, and orders dashboard) storing data in the key value store.                        |
| **3. Config Server**        | Centralized configuration management service for all components. Reads config data from another GitHub repo.                               |
| **4. Api Gateway**        | A gateway which api calls from the ordering UI of the online store pass through. Has a rate limiter and light security.                                           |
| **5. Consistent Hashing Layer**    | Implements a ring-based consistent hashing algorithm used in the KVS and rate limiter.                                                                 |
| **6. Deployment Automation**       | Scripts to automate deployment. Has kubernetes (Helm) and docker compose versions.                                                 |



## **1. Key Value Store**
*A distributed, durable, in-memory key-value store built from scratch.*


| ‚úÖ Module            | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Metadata Server** | Coordinates metadata (storage nodes, tables, partitions, partition leaders etc.) and performs RAFT-based leader election and replication.                                                                                                           |
| **Storage Server**  | Handles in-memory daata storage, with leader-follower replication using gRPC or REST (configurable). The leader is elected by the active metadata server.                                                                                |
| **Dashboard**       | Provides real-time visibility into the cluster‚Äôs health, metadata (storage nodes, tables, partitions, and replicas), items, and item versions. Also supports admin operations like creating tables. |
| **Client Library**  | A lightweight library used by client applications to interact with the key value store via REST API calls.                                                                                                                        |
